# The Science of Music

This particular class is about __The Science of Music:__ From the
physics of sound generation to the cognitive abilities of humans to
listen to music and to be moved by it. It has a total of 12 units â€”
each unit composed of a synopsis, specific content, quizzes and a
section with references. A large number of images, animations,
(interactive) audio and video examples are used within these units
to make asynchronous and blended learning a pleasant experience. In
these units, the focus is both on scientific research as well as the
artistic application thereof. The materials are supplemented by Max
patches (see [cycling74](www.cycling74.com)).

Through the gradual learning of these units, you will get an
overview of current practices in the fields of psychology of music
and their application to multimedia composition. You will be able to
competently discuss the impact of cognitive science on the
understanding and appreciation of music and to gain insight into
current research projects in these fields.
