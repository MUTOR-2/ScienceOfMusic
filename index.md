# Welcome to the MUsic Technology Online Repository

MUTOR offers open courses and license-free teaching materials for distant and blended learning in music technology. The repository was designed to answer to the needs of bachelor and master students as well as the general public interested in questions such as "what is multimedia (in a primarily musical context)", "how do we perceive and process music cognitively", "what is microtonality", "how do we synthesize new sounds", "how do we combine sounds with images", "how do we move sounds in space", "how do we track the movements and gestures of performers" and many more. Currently, we have completed a course on __The Science of Music__ and are starting a second one on __The History and Practice of Multimedia__. So enjoy the content that we have already created and stay tuned for more.

We would like to thank the [HOOU GmbH](https://www.hoou.de/institutions/hochschule-fur-musik-und-theater) for their support.
